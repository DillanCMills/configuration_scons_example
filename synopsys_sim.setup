-- NOTES
-- We can just elaborate the configs and the tool looks to the synopsys_sim.setup
-- for the libraries.  You can override that with -liblist but using the setup
-- file is more straightforward.
 
-- from the VCS documentation:
-- Look for the libraries specified in -liblist at the command line, or
--   look for the libraries specified in the synopsys_sim.setup file if
--   -liblist is not passed.
